	<h2> In Honor of Kobe </h2>
	<p id="paragraph1"> On January 26th, the world was shocked when they were informed that NBA and Laker legend Kobe Bryant had passed away tragically in a helicopter crash. 
	This shook the entire basketball world and the entire Lakers organization, but everyone knew that the best way that the Lakers could honor Kobe was by going out and winning the 2020 NBA title. </p>
	<h2> Hiatus and The Bubble </h2>
	<p id="paragraph2"> On March 14th, the NBA was shut down until further notice due to COVID-19. Fast forward 6 months later, it was agreed that all games would be played at Disney World in Orlando where no fans would be allowed 
	into the arena. Although it wasn't easy the Lakers went on to beat the Portland Trailblazers, Houston Rockets, Denver Nuggets and Miami Heat to be crowned the Champions! </p>
